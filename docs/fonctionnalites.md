# GoProxify Features

## 1. Overview

GoProxify is a **distributed, secure reverse proxy** compiled as a **single Go binary** with zero runtime dependency. The instance personality is determined at startup by the CLI subcommand or the `GOPROXIFY_MODE` environment variable.

The product comes in **three complementary personalities**:

| Component | Role | Persistence | Exposed ports |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Edge** | Data Plane — high-performance routing engine + WS hub (+ optional Access) | RAM + encrypted cache | `:80`, `:443` TCP+UDP, `:8000` internal + WS; Access `:2222` / `:8444` if enabled |
| **Admin** | Control Plane — UI, API, MCP, alerting, Access | SQLite | `:9443` |
| **Agent** | Discovery & Telemetry — Docker sidecar | Volatile | `:9191` Prometheus, `:51820` WireGuard (no inbound port for control plane) |

---

## 2. Edge — Data Plane

### Supported protocols

| Protocol | Details |
|---|---|
| HTTP/1.1 | Full reverse proxy with header management |
| HTTP/2 | Stream multiplexing, ALPN negotiation |
| HTTP/3 QUIC | UDP transport, `Alt-Svc` negotiation |
| WebSocket | HTTP → WS upgrade handled natively |
| gRPC | Transparent proxy over HTTP/2 |
| TCP L4 | Pure stream: local port → remote host:port, native SSL passthrough, L4 load balancing |
| UDP L4 | Pure tunnel, bytes in/out metrics |

### TLS

- **TLS termination**: certificates pushed into RAM only via `GetCertificate` — never written to disk
- **SNI Passthrough**: passive detection by reading the first 5 bytes of the Client Hello (no decryption)
- **ALPN negotiation**: `h2` and `http/1.1`
- **mTLS client**: client certificate validation (Milestone 5)
- **Inter-Edge delegation**: an entry Edge can forward a domain to another Edge — **Passthrough** (raw TLS tunnel) or **Terminate** (TLS at entry + HTTP(S) proxy + `X-Forwarded-For`) modes. See [docs/delegation.md](delegation.md).

### Autonomous operation without Admin

The Edge can operate **autonomously** if the Admin is temporarily unreachable:

- Automatic backup of the routing table and certificates in an **encrypted local cache** (`/etc/goproxify/edge-cache.gpx`)
- Triggered on each push received from Admin + configurable interval
- On startup without reachable Admin: automatic load from cache
- **Automatic reconnect** as soon as Admin becomes available again → cache update
- Explicit log indicating startup mode (live / local cache)

### Performance

- `sync.Map` for routing table: atomic updates **with no connection interruption**
- Network buffer `sync.Pool`: stable P99 under load, reduced GC pressure
- Configurable Gzip compression
- Disk proxy cache (planned)

### Security

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| IP/CIDR filtering | Built-in profiles: Cloudflare, Tor, Bogons, custom ranges; feeds aggregated (dedup + merged prefixes), private ranges excluded from deny lists, conditional downloads (ETag/304), exponential retry backoff with visible failure state, and a shrink guard against emptied/truncated feeds and an `ip_profile_refresh_failed` alert after N consecutive failures |
| Geo-IP | Allow or block by country (MaxMind GeoLite2; auto-download at startup) |
| Rate limiting | Token bucket per IP or authenticated user — `key_by` field: `ip` (default), `jwt_sub`, `jwt_email`, `jwt_claim:<name>` |
| Backpressure | Per-route cap on concurrent requests (`backpressure`: `max_inflight`, `queue`, `queue_timeout_ms`); extra requests wait in a bounded queue, then get `503` + `Retry-After`. WebSocket upgrades are exempt. Metrics `gpx_backpressure_*` — see [docs/security.md](security.md#backpressure-par-route) |
| HTTP security headers | HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy, etc. |
| CORS | Configurable origins, methods and headers |
| Server fingerprint masking | Removal of revealing headers (`Server`, `X-Powered-By`) |
| WAF | Native Go engine, 13 OWASP CRS-4 rule sets, request **and** response inspection, detect/block mode, custom rules hot-reload — see [docs/security.md](security.md#waf) |
| Sentinel | Per-IP behavioral detection: sliding window, immediate ban on signal, global anti-DDoS RPS, optional bounded **tarpit** (holds the response to blocked IPs) — see [docs/security.md](security.md#sentinel) |
| Native Go Fail2Ban | Automatic banning after N failures, no external dependency |
| CrowdSec | LAPI stream bouncer → bans pushed to Edge (403), Docker compatible |
| Automatic rules engine | Event-driven conditions (critical CVE, ban spike, silent engine, error rate, repeat offender IP, node offline, cert expiring) → actions (disable proxy, ban IP, alert, strict mode, webhook call, trigger backup); cooldown, dry-run, history — see [docs/security.md](security.md#automatic-rules-engine) |
| SSO | GitHub OAuth2, LDAP/Active Directory, SAML 2.0, OIDC (Google, Microsoft/Entra, Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Zitadel, Casdoor, Dex, Authentik, Authelia) |
| JWT validation | JWKS (planned) |

### Request transformation pipeline

Each route can declare a `RequestTransform` block (Admin UI → proxy → **Transform** tab):

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `rewrite_from` / `rewrite_to` | URL prefix rewrite (e.g. `/api/v1` → `/v1`) |
| `add_request_headers` | Headers to inject into the upstream request |
| `remove_request_headers` | Headers to strip from the upstream request |
| `add_response_headers` | Headers to inject into the client response |
| `remove_response_headers` | Headers to strip from the client response |

The middleware applies first in the chain, before WAF and upstream routing. Hot-reload without Edge restart.

### L4 mTLS Edge↔Edge tunnel

The `internal/edge/tunnel` package provides a persistent encrypted TCP channel between two Edges (inter-datacenter L4 traffic, relay for backends unreachable from the entry Edge).

**Architecture:**
```
Edge A (client)          Edge B (server)
   │                          │
   ├─ mTLS TLS 1.3 ──────────▶│:9443
   │   CONNECT-like:           │
   │   "host:port\n"  ──────▶  │ dial TCP target
   │   ◀── "OK\n"              │ bidirectional pipe
   │   [L4 stream]   ◁────────▶│
```

- **Manager** (client side): peer pool `PeerConfig{Name, Addr, CACert, CertPEM, KeyPEM}`, automatic reconnect, failover to other registered peers
- **Serve** (server side): mTLS listener `RequireAndVerifyClientCert`, TLS 1.3 min, CONNECT-like protocol on one ASCII line
- Usage: `Manager.Dial(peerName, targetAddr)` returns a ready-to-use `net.Conn` for proxying or L4 access

### Resilience

- **Load balancing**: Round Robin, Weighted, **Adaptive** (CPU×0.5 + mem×0.3 + disk IO×0.2 via Agent WS metrics)
- **Configurable active health checks**: `HealthCheckConfig` per route — `path`, `interval`, `timeout`, `healthy_threshold`, `unhealthy_threshold`; `StartChecksFromRoutes` replaces the global fixed-interval call
- **Failover**: short quarantine + try next backend on dial/proxy failure
- **Circuit Breaker**: thread-safe (mutex), `RecordSuccess`/`RecordFailure` called from handler after each attempt; automatic isolation of failing backends
- **Retry policy** with configurable exponential backoff
- **Sticky sessions** via cookie
- **Slow-start** (`slow_start_sec`): a backend that is newly added or recovers from an outage ramps up from ~5 % to 100 % of its share over the configured window; sticky sessions keep their backend. Metric `gpx_backend_slowstart_shifted_total`
- **Configurable server timeouts**: `ReadTimeout`, `WriteTimeout`, `IdleTimeout`, `ReadHeaderTimeout` HTTP/QUIC — configurable from Admin (Security > Server settings) and propagated to Edges via WebSocket

### Observability

- **Live topology** (Infrastructure → Topology): Admin → Edges → Agents map refreshed every 5 s in place, each node showing health, request rate (req/s over the last 60 s, with a 2-minute sparkline) and a **risk score 0-100** (highest of: offline, rejection rate 403/429, 5xx rate, CPU/RAM pressure; the dominant cause is shown). API `GET /api/v1/nodes/live`, CLI `goproxify nodes live`, MCP `get_topology_live` — see [docs/api_specs.md](api_specs.md#get-apiv1nodeslive)

- **Async JSON access log**: client IP, domain, method, HTTP code, duration, upstream, HTTP version
- **Structured JSON system log** for all components, with rotation
- **Prometheus metrics** exposed on `/metrics` — full instrumentation of all services: `gpx_edge_*`, `gpx_backend_*`, `gpx_backend_up`, `gpx_peer_sync_duration_seconds`, `gpx_waf_profiles_active`, `gpx_portal_sessions_active`, `gpx_pipeline_*`, `gpx_tls_*`, `gpx_auth_*`, `gpx_ratelimit_*`, `gpx_traffic_*`, `gpx_routing_*`, `gpx_f2b_*`, `gpx_crowdsec_*`, `gpx_rulesengine_*`, `gpx_vulnscan_*`, `gpx_admin_http_*` — see `docs/services.md`
- **OpenTelemetry tracing** (OTLP/HTTP, W3C Trace Context): one server span per request continuing an incoming `traceparent`, a client span per backend call (`traceparent` forwarded to the backend, so the trace spans caller → Edge → backend), Sentinel / ban decisions as span events (`sentinel.signal`, `ban.blocked`, no IP recorded) and route attributes (`gpx.route.id`, `gpx.route.host`). `X-Trace-Id` is returned to the client. Enable with `engine.tracing_endpoint` (`host:port` for plain HTTP, or a full `https://…` URL) or from Admin (`tracing_endpoint`, pushed to Edges; applied live); `engine.tracing_sample_ratio` (default `1`) samples new traces while honoring the caller's decision. Without an endpoint the Edge stays transparent: an incoming `traceparent` is still forwarded, nothing is exported. `/metrics` is not traced
- **JSON audit log**: full traceability of all operations

### GoProxify Access (SSH / shell portal)

Operator portal served by the **Edge** (not Admin):

- **Dual façade**: web terminal (xterm.js) + standard `ssh` client with UUID token (`ssh -p 2222 <uuid>@<edge>`)
- **Targets**: VM / bare-metal (`sshd`) or Docker containers (`docker exec` via Agent)
- **Vault**: SSH login + password or private key, encrypted on the Edge (never exposed to Admin)
- Optional **2FA** (TOTP / OTP email); TTL / one-shot sessions / revocation; metadata audit
- Config & catalogue pushed from Admin (see §3)

---

## 3. Admin — Control Plane

### First start

- Automatic detection of missing SQLite database on first launch
- **Guided initialization screen**: enter administrator email and password
- Generation of ECDSA P-256 key for JWT token signing

### REST API

Endpoints on `:9443` — two families:

- `/api/v1/` — session JWT authentication (human administrators) **or** PAT `gpx_pat_*`
- `/internal/v1/` — pairing token authentication (Edges and Agents, backward compat)

| Resource | Operations |
|---|---|
| Proxies (HTTP, TCP, UDP) | Full CRUD + immediate push to Edge(s) |
| Users | Create, edit, delete, password reset |
| Teams | Access organization by scope |
| Pairing tokens | Generate, list, revoke (`gpx_edge_*`, `gpx_join_*`) |
| User API tokens (PAT) | Self-service `/api/v1/me/tokens` — resource scopes, optional expiry |
| Snippets | Reusable profiles: IP, TLS, CORS, rate-limit, auth providers, DNS providers |
| Nodes | Registration, cluster state, accept/reject pending |
| Agents | List, approve / revoke (pending → approved workflow) |
| Declared / bootstrap | Wizard declared nodes; QR tickets `/i/{token}` + `curl|bash` |
| Domains | Apex / wildcards, entry Edge, ACME DNS, **delegation** Passthrough or Terminate to another Edge |
| Security | Bans, CrowdSec threats, CVE, Fail2Ban, overview |
| Access | Destination catalogue, SMTP user invite, HTML templates, portal options per Edge, audit |

### MCP server

Endpoint `https://<admin>:9443/mcp` — MCP protocol `2025-03-26`, JSON-RPC 2.0 + SSE.

- **Auth:** PAT only (`Authorization: Bearer gpx_pat_…`) — UI session JWT is rejected
- **Scopes:** each tool requires a scope (`proxies:read|write|delete`, `nodes:read|write`, `audit:read` for security, `portal:read|write` for Access, …) ∩ current account rights
- **Read:** proxies, nodes, agents, declared-nodes, alerts, metrics, backups, users, snippets, domains, certs, logs, teams, audit, bans / threats / CVE, alert channels/rules, auth providers, IP profiles, Access (config, catalogue, users, templates, audit)
- **Write:** `create_proxy`, `update_proxy`, `set_proxy_enabled`, `delete_proxy`, `approve_agent`, `revoke_agent`, `create_declared_node`, `create_bootstrap_ticket`, `accept_node` / `reject_node`, `create_security_ban`, `delete_security_ban`, `create_alert_channel`, `delete_alert_channel`, `create_alert_rule`, `delete_alert_rule`, `create_auth_provider`, `delete_auth_provider`, `create_ip_profile`, `delete_ip_profile`, `create_snippet`, `delete_snippet`, `create_domain`, `renew_domain`, `obtain_cert`, Access tools (`update_portal_*`, `invite_portal_user`, `push_portal`, templates…)
- **Sentinel dry-run:** `simulate_sentinel_config` (scope `logs:read`) replays recent access logs against a candidate Sentinel config and diffs it with the current one (blocked requests, bans, likely false positives) without applying anything
- Documentation: [docs/mcp.md](mcp.md)
- **Access control (`/mcp-access`, admin only):**
  - **Source IP allowlist:** admins restrict `/mcp` to a list of IP/CIDR entries (`GET`/`PUT /api/v1/mcp-access/allowed-ips`); enforced server-side before PAT auth even runs. Empty list (default) = no restriction.
  - **Backend destination allowlist:** `create_proxy` / `update_proxy` may only point to allowed destinations (`GET`/`PUT /api/v1/mcp-access/allowed-backends`; private networks and `*.internal`/`*.local`/`*.svc` by default), so a prompt-injected agent cannot redirect traffic to an external server.
  - **Active users:** table of every user holding an active PAT on the instance, with their scopes — "who can use the MCP" at a glance.
  - **Scope catalogue (reference):** each scope's covered MCP tools. Scope selection at issuance stays self-service on `/api-tokens` (a PAT is personal to its holder).

### Automation menu

`Automatisation` groups three sub-pages, all admin-only:

| Page | Route | Content |
|------|-------|---------|
| Automatic rules | `security-rules` | Rules engine CRUD, dry-run, execution history (see [docs/security.md](security.md#automatic-rules-engine)) |
| Alert channels | `alert-channels` | Notification channels (email, webhook, ntfy, gotify) |
| Rule store | `rules-store` | 15 preconfigured rule templates (`GET /api/v1/rules-engine/templates`), one-click install via `POST /api/v1/rules-engine/templates/{id}/install` |

### Architecture wizard

The **Infrastructure** page and the wizard share one **architecture schema**, drawn top to bottom: Internet, Edges (HA group with leader and quorum), the Admin linked to the Edges by a "manages" link, Agents linked over WebSocket, plus a summary strip (req/s, nodes online, HA quorum, alert). Each node is a card (role icon, status, host, capabilities, throughput, session availability strip). The schema is responsive (single column on mobile). Its model (host → role → capability) comes from **`architecture.json`** (`GET /api/v1/architecture`); live state is only an overlay.

**Infrastructure → Edit architecture** opens the same schema in edit mode: add nodes with the "+ Add" buttons, pick one to edit its host, capabilities (Access, HA, TLS, Docker, Podman, Portainer, K8s), domains and delegations in the inspector. A single **Save** button writes `architecture.json`; nothing is created or approved on save.

Each host has a **Configuration** modal: *Formats* (Compose, `.env`, command line, network flows, declared JSON, install ticket), *Differences* (declared vs. what the node reports) and *Versions* (the 50 kept versions of `architecture.json`: view, diff against the current state, restore). The install ticket (QR / `/i/{token}` link / `curl|bash`, 24 h) and the pre-approval of the host's agents are only created when you click **Generate a ticket**. Nodes declared this way can be **auto-accepted** on connection.

The canvas state lives in **`architecture.json`** (Admin `state/` folder), the reference file of the architecture: declared nodes, Edges, RBAC scopes. The Admin reconnects the Edges it describes at startup (address taken from `endpoint`, or from the node's `reachable_host`), aligns its database on the file, and keeps the previous **50 versions** of the file (`goproxify architecture versions|restore`, `GET /api/v1/architecture/versions`). Edges of an HA group announce their Raft peers in their heartbeat, so the Admin discovers the other members without extra configuration.

### Multi-Edge delegation

A domain can be **delegated**: the entry Edge (DNS / public IP) forwards traffic to a target Edge.

| Mode | Behavior | Client IP on target Edge |
|---|---|---|
| **Passthrough** | Raw TLS tunnel (SNI) | Entry Edge's IP |
| **Terminate** | TLS terminated at entry + HTTP(S) proxy + `X-Forwarded-For` | Public IP (if seen by entry) |

Detailed documentation: [delegation.md](delegation.md).

### WebSocket control plane

Admin maintains a **persistent WS connection** to each registered Edge (Admin→Edge). This connection replaces HTTP push calls to `/internal/v1/*`:

- **Automatic reconnect**: exponential backoff 1s → 60s + jitter
- **Full-sync on reconnect**: complete state automatically resent
- **Message queue**: messages emitted during a disconnect are queued and delivered on reconnect
- **Immediate propagation**: any config change is sent in real time to the affected Edge

### Agent approval

Agents connecting for the first time via `JOIN_TOKEN` appear in `pending` status. The operator approves via UI or API (`POST /api/v1/agents/:id/approve`). The Edge immediately sends the first `agent_hmac` via WS.

### TLS / ACME DNS-01 management

- **Wildcard Let's Encrypt certificates** via DNS-01 challenge
- Supported DNS providers: **OVH, Cloudflare, Gandi, Route53, Hetzner**
- Automatic renewal 30 days before expiry
- Push decoded certificates to Edge in RAM only (never on disk on Edge side)

### Certificate Hub (v0.8)

Feature suite around the TLS certificate lifecycle.

**ACME monitoring — single entry point** (`/acme-monitor`, sidebar Access → Monitoring ACME)
- Unifies what used to be three separate menus ("Certificates", "Certificate deployment", "ACME Monitoring") into one page — the other two are removed
- Dashboard: status per cert (`ok` / `warning ≤30d` / `critical ≤7d` / `expired`), global KPIs, inline renewal button
- Per-row actions: **Deploy** (opens the Deploy Hub drawer below) and **Edit** (opens the source domain's modal — DNS provider, manual PEM, entry Edge, delegation — disabled when the cert has no linked domain, e.g. manual import); `domain_id` field in `GET /api/v1/certs/acme-monitor` links the emitted cert back to its `domains` row
- Automatic alerts: `cert_expiring_soon` (warning ≤30d, critical ≤7d) emitted to the existing alert engine
- **Multi-DNS providers**: manage multiple named providers (e.g. `cloudflare-prod`, `ovh-zone2`) via the "DNS Providers" section of the ACME Monitoring page; each provider has a type (`cloudflare`, `ovh`, `gandi`, `hetzner`, `route53`) and JSON credentials; full CRUD via `/api/v1/acme/providers`

**External certificate import**
- `POST /api/v1/certs/import`: PEM + private key upload — domain auto-extracted from SAN/CN, upserted in DB, real-time push to Edges
- Modal interface in the `acme-monitor` page

**Deploy Hub** (reachable via the "Deploy" button on each cert row in ACME Monitoring — no longer a standalone menu)
- **Deploy targets**: webhook (POST HMAC-SHA256 signed) or `ssh_exec` (script executed on target machine with `GPX_CERT_PEM / GPX_KEY_PEM / GPX_DOMAIN`)
- Automatic trigger on each ACME renewal + manual trigger
- Audit history per target (`cert_deploy_history`)
- `cert_deploy_failed` alert on failure

**Pull tokens**
- Secure tokens (HMAC-SHA256, TTL, max_uses) for pull download via `curl`
- 7 output formats: `pem`, `key`, `fullchain`, `der`, `der_key`, `pkcs12` (password), `json`
- Public endpoint `GET /api/v1/cert-bundle?token=…&format=…`

### Internal CA (internal certificate authority)

Self-signed root CA generation and issuance of internal server/client certificates, outside ACME — for internal services with no public exposure.

- **Root CA generation**: ECDSA P-256 self-signed root, configurable validity (default 10 years); private key persisted on disk under `certs/internal-ca/<ca_id>/`, never in the DB (only the cert PEM and metadata are stored)
- **Certificate issuance**: server (`ExtKeyUsageServerAuth`) or client (`ExtKeyUsageClientAuth`) leaf certificates signed by a chosen internal CA, with DNS/IP SANs, configurable validity (default 397 days)
- **Revocation**: certificates can be marked revoked (`internal_ca_certs.revoked`)
- `GET/POST /api/v1/internal-ca`, `GET/POST /api/v1/internal-ca/{id}/certs`, `DELETE /api/v1/internal-ca/{id}/certs/{certID}`
- CLI: `goproxify internal-ca create-ca|list-ca|issue|list-certs|revoke`
- MCP tools: `create_internal_ca`, `list_internal_cas`, `issue_internal_cert`, `list_internal_certs`, `revoke_internal_cert`
- Admin UI: "Internal CA" section embedded in the "Domains & certificates" page (`/acme-monitor`) — create a CA, list CAs, side panel to issue/revoke certificates per CA

### Granular alerting

Alertmanager-inspired model: each rule independently defines its scope, triggers and channels. The same event can notify multiple teams on different channels.

**Rule scope**:
- Target node(s)
- Domain pattern (glob: `infra.*.com`, `*.prod.*`)
- Team(s)
- Component (`edge` / `agent` / `admin`)
- Minimum severity (`info` / `warning` / `critical`)

**Configurable triggers**:
- Edge/Agent node offline
- Certificate expiring in < N days
- CVE detected on a backend
  - The HTTP scanner rejects private targets (RFC1918/ULA), localhost and cloud metadata by default (anti-SSRF). To scan Docker/LAN backends: `GPX_VULNSCAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE=true` on Admin, or via the toggle in the UI (Security > CVE Scanner, Edge view only — the manual scan trigger, the private-network toggle and the scanner status card all live on the Edge side; the Admin view shows only the aggregated CVE list across all Edges, with an Edge column identifying which Edge reported each CVE).
- New Fail2Ban ban (threshold: N bans/hour)
- Critical CrowdSec decision
- Sensitive configuration change
- Scheduled backup failure
- HTTP error rate > threshold on a proxy
- P95 latency > threshold on a proxy
- N failed admin login attempts

**Quality of service**: anti-spam rate limiting per trigger, grouping of similar alerts (configurable cooldown).

### Scheduled backups

- **Edge**: routing table snapshot (JSON), per-proxy versioning, navigable history, per-proxy rollback
- **Admin**: JSON dump (users, token metadata without secrets, snippets, alert channels/rules, declared nodes, plus configuration tables: settings incl. MCP IP allowlist, automatic rules, teams/scopes, workspaces, domains, cert deploy targets, auth providers, IP profiles, tunnel configs, error/portal pages, fail2ban/CrowdSec config); secrets redacted (a redacted secret never overwrites an existing value on restore); optional AES-GCM encryption via `GPX_BACKUP_KEY`
- **Configurable cron** scheduling, configurable retention (number of snapshots)
- Restore with diff preview before applying
- CLI: `goproxify backup create/list/restore`

### Third-party config import

Automatic source format detection. Two modes: paste content or import one or more files. Preview before validation, partial import possible.

Supported formats: nginx, HAProxy, Traefik YAML, Traefik TOML, Traefik Labels, Caddy, Zoraxy, BunkerWeb, CSV, GoProxify native JSON.

### Coordinated cluster update

- Version inconsistency detection between nodes (via heartbeat)
- Alert if Edges or Agents run different versions
- Triggered from UI (per node or entire cluster) or via CLI
- Configurable rolling update (one node at a time, validation between each)
- Cluster rollback orchestrated from Admin

### Web interface

- Dashboard: cluster state, real-time metrics
- Unified proxy list view (HTTP/HTTPS + TCP + UDP) — Docker labels greyed out read-only
- Adaptive create/edit form by proxy type
- Interactive Docker Compose label generator (HTTP, TCP, UDP)
- TLS certificate, snippet, token, user, team management
- Integrations: Prism (traffic analysis), Security dashboard, Backups, Import
- **Logs**: aggregated view (access + system + audit), filters, pagination, live mode via WebSocket
- **Prism**: KPIs, time series, GeoIP map, HTTP codes, top IPs/paths/referrers, CSV/JSON/HTML/PDF exports

## 4. Agent — Discovery & Telemetry

### Docker discovery

- Listens to Docker events via Unix socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`, mounted read-only)
- Detects `goproxify.*` labels on containers at startup and in real time (start/stop/die)
- **Hot-connects** the Edge to the application's private Docker bridge network (apps expose no port on the host)
- Transmits network configuration to Admin (validated token)
- Discovered proxies marked `source: "label"` → read-only in UI

### Supported Docker labels

> Full reference: [docs/labels.md](labels.md)

Key examples:

```yaml
goproxify.enable: "true"
goproxify.host: "app.example.com"
goproxify.port: "3000"
goproxify.tls: "true"
goproxify.waf: "block"
goproxify.sentinel.whitelist: "10.0.0.0/8"
goproxify.canary: "true"
goproxify.canary.weight: "10"
```

### Kubernetes discovery

Symmetrically to Docker mode, the Agent can discover annotated Kubernetes resources:

- Watches `Ingress` and `Service` resources carrying the **label** `goproxify.enabled: "true"` (a Kubernetes label selector cannot match annotations, so this is a label, unlike Docker's `goproxify.enable`)
- Configuration comes from `goproxify.*` **annotations** with the same semantics as the Docker labels (see [docs/labels.md](labels.md)): `host` (CSV = aliases; on an Ingress the rule host wins), `port`, `backend`, `tls`, `waf`, `rate_limit`, `limit_conn`, `backpressure`, `slow_start`, `jwt`, `mtls`, `headers.add/remove`, `cache`, etc. The label prefix is configurable (`kubernetes.label_prefix`)
- Values deduced from the resource (host, backend, TLS from `spec.tls`) take precedence over the annotations
- Proxies created read-only in UI (source `k8s`)
- Requires a `ServiceAccount` with `get/watch/list` access on `ingresses` and `services`
- Compatible with multi-namespace Kubernetes deployments; target namespace configurable in `agent.json`

```json
{
  "kubernetes": {
    "enabled": true,
    "kubeconfig": "/etc/goproxify/kubeconfig",
    "namespaces": ["production", "staging"]
  }
}
```

### Horizontal auto-scaling

- Configurable triggers: container CPU (Agent telemetry) and/or request rate / P95 latency (Edge metrics)
- Coordinated decision by Admin (min/max instance rules)
- Instance creation/deletion via `docker compose up --scale` or `docker run`
- Hot-add to Edge routing table without interruption
- Compatible with resource-weighted adaptive load balancing
- Configurable cooldown between decisions (anti-flapping)

### Health escalation

Progressive recovery logic for `unhealthy` containers:

1. **Simple restart** (`docker restart`)
2. **Recreate** if still unhealthy after configurable delay (`docker rm` + `docker run`)
3. **Rollback** to previous image
4. **Quarantine**: removal from LB pool + operator alert

Delays and thresholds configurable per container via `goproxify.healthcheck.*` labels.

### Image lifecycle management

- Detection of available updates (local vs registry digest comparison)
- Per-container strategies: `auto`, `scheduled` (cron), `manual`
- Pull + recreate without interruption if multiple replicas
- Automatic rollback if container does not return `healthy` within configured delay
- Optional prune after successful update

### Log forwarding

- Collection of labelled container logs (`docker logs --follow`) opt-in (`goproxify.logs: "true"`)
- Real-time streaming to Admin
- Correlation with Edge/Agent/Admin logs in Logs view
- Configurable rotation and retention per container

### System telemetry

- Reads `/proc/stat` and `/proc/meminfo`
- Prometheus export on `:9191/metrics`
- Data used by Edge adaptive load balancing (host + containers via WS)

### Persistent WS connectivity

Agent maintains a **persistent WS connection** to the Edge (Agent→Edge). This connection:

- **Replaces the HTTP 30s heartbeat**: heartbeat sent via WS if connected, HTTP as fallback
- **Transmits discovered containers** in real time via `containers` message
- **Streams per-container metrics** (CPU, mem, latency) via `metrics` message every 10s
- **Sends lifecycle events** (start, stop, scale, die) via `event` message
- **Automatic reconnect**: exponential backoff 1s → 60s + jitter
- The Agent exposes **no inbound port** for the control plane

**Authentication:**
1. First start: `JOIN_TOKEN` (TTL 24h) → `pending` state
2. After Admin approval: rotating `agent_hmac` (automatic rotation every hour)

### Adaptive LB

Docker metrics (**CPU**, **memory**, **disk IO**) of `goproxify.enable` containers are streamed to the Edge every **10s** via WS (`metrics`). Score per IP:

`cpu×0.5 + mem×0.3 + disk_io×0.2` — lowest score backend receives the request.

- **Local pool**: multiple containers with the same `goproxify.host` → one `docker-host:…` multi-backend route.
- **Failover**: proxy failure → ~15s quarantine → try another pool backend (no 502 as long as one healthy remains).
- **Cross-Edge**: if the same host is discovered on Edge A and Edge B, peer sync + `gateway/tunnel` tunnel to the remote IP via the owner Edge (see [architecture.md](architecture.md#adaptive-load-balancing)).

P95 latency / error_rate: fields planned in payload, not used in v1 score.

### Canary and Shadow Mirror

**Manual** configuration on the proxy (UI / API): `CanaryConfig` (weight %, header, cookie) and `ShadowConfig` (fire-and-forget mirror).

Docker labels `goproxify.canary` / `goproxify.shadow`: automatic detection via Agent discovery — the Edge activates `CanaryConfig` / `ShadowConfig` on the `docker-host:` route without manual config. The canary/shadow container stays outside the LB pool (same `goproxify.host` as normal backends).

### Network connectivity

- Optional **WireGuard** tunnels for inter-node communication (port `:51820` UDP)

## 8. High Availability

### Edge — independent groups

- Edges organize into **groups** (by datacenter, region, customer…)
- Each group elects its **coordinator via the Raft algorithm** (majority required)
- Any config change is validated by the group majority before applying
- If the network partitions a group, only the majority half can elect a coordinator
- On loss of Admin access, each Edge falls back to its **encrypted local cache**

### Admin — rqlite

- **3 Admin instances** continuously synchronized via rqlite (distributed SQLite over Raft)
- Writes go through the **leader node**, reads on any node
- If one instance goes down, the other two continue without interruption
- Automatic leader failover in seconds

### Inter-node connectivity

- WireGuard tunnels managed by the Agent for secure communication between groups
- Adaptive load balancing based on metrics reported by Agents

## 9. Deployment

| Mode | Details |
|---|---|
| **Docker Compose** | `docker compose up -d` — recommended, `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-dev.yml` files provided |
| **Bare-metal** | Interactive `setup.sh` script — module selection (Admin / Edge / Agent) |
| **systemd** | Hardened service (systemd units with sandboxing) |
| **setcap** | `setcap cap_net_bind_service` to listen on ports < 1024 without root |

Configuration: JSON files in `config/` (`admin.json`, `edge.json`, `agent.json`) + `GPX_*` prefixed environment variables (production priority).
